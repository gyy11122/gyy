For me now, the changes in light and shadow are incredibly elegant  and beautiful.,but for a primary school student, the first drawing class meant  nothing more than repetitive and boring line drawing. </p>
        <p><br>
          Fortunately, I was a timid child when I was young, so for every  three hours of class, I diligently completed my learning tasks. </p>
        <p> Therefore, after going through line drawing, shape drawing, I was  able to complete a complete drawing. From geometric stone sculptures to still life, from copying to life  drawing, <br>
          I steadily completed each step, laying a solid foundation for my  future studies.</p>
        <p><br>
      This is my drawing from elementary school, although it may not look  very polished now.</p></td>
