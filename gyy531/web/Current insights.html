        <p>Sketching is a very basic form of painting - it reflects the  fundamental principles of painting by depicting objects in a certain way. <br>
          The distinction between black, white, and gray is based on the  position of the light source and the object's inherent color. <br>
          Sketching breaks down the various shapes and colors of the  three-dimensional world into a series of long or short, deep or shallow lines -  much like how we used velocity-time graphs to find displacement in middle  school, <br>
          in essence converting complex relationships into very simple lines.</p>
      <p>Today, I am very grateful for my persistence and efforts over the  years, which gave me the opportunity to slow down in today's fast-paced life,  and gave me the opportunity to express my understanding of beauty with the  relationship between black and white and gray. </p></td>
